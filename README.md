# Computer-Organization-Projects
Hi there,
I am a computer engineering student at Istanbul Technical University and this repository is for the projects that I have done during the Computer Organization course togather with the reports.Basically I implemented a Basic Computer at the end of the project. I uploaded project 1 and 2 togather because project 2 is already using components of project 1. The grades that I have got were for the first project 96.34 and for the second project 100.
I fixed the issues of project 1 after seeing the small errors. It was fun and educative process while implementing the basic computer structure with verilog.
